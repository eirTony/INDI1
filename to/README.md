This directory contains files (some binary) to be deployed on a running system in conjunction with 
deliverables from this project. 
Storing them here allows them to be included with the parallel source code changes.

Included:

- `lang  to `D:/lang` on wWindows development environments (TBD soon on *nix)

- `data` to `./data` sibling to deliverable execution directory

- `detectors` to `./detectors` sibling to deliverable execution directory

- `bin4[w32]` to `.` within deliverable execution directory on Qt4 Windows 32-bit release run environments

- `dbg4[w32]` to `.` within deliverable execution directory on Qt4 Windows 32-bit debug run environments
